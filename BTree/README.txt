This is a practice from the following topic: 
write a program to duplicate the tree structure and data. Return the root of the new tree. 

typedef struct tree_item
{
  int value;
  struct _tree_item *letf;
  struct _tree_item *right;
}tree_item;

tree_item *deep_copy(tree_item* root)
{
}

deepcopy1 and deepcopy2 both are functions that implement the deep copy of a tree with slightly different methods. 
deepcopy2 is more elegant.
